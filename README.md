## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- MongoDB Atlas account (or local MongoDB)
- Stripe account (test keys)
- SendGrid account (for email)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ihanmx/e-store-backend.git
cd e-store-backend
npm install
```

### ⚙️ Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root:

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/<dbname>
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_...
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG....
```

### ▶️ Run

```bash
# Development (with auto-restart)
nodemon app.js

# Production
node app.js
```

App runs at `http://localhost:3000`

## 🧠 Key Concepts Explained

### 🔐 Sessions & Authentication
User login state is stored server-side using `express-session` with MongoDB as the session store (`connect-mongodb-session`). Passwords are hashed with `bcrypt` before saving.

### 🛡️ Authorization
The `is-auth` middleware protects routes by checking `req.session.isLoggedIn`. Admin routes additionally verify that the product being edited/deleted belongs to the logged-in user.

### 📁 File Uploads
`Multer` handles `multipart/form-data` requests. Files are stored to the `images/` directory using `diskStorage`. Only PNG/JPG/JPEG files pass the `fileFilter`.

### 🧾 PDF Invoices
`PDFKit` streams the generated PDF simultaneously to the file system and the HTTP response, avoiding buffering the entire file in memory.

### 📄 Pagination
Products are paginated using Mongoose's `.skip()` and `.limit()`. The controller passes `currentPage`, `hasNextPage`, `hasPreviousPage`, `nextPage`, `previousPage`, and `lastPage` to the view for the pagination partial.

### 💳 Stripe Checkout
On checkout, a Stripe `Session` is created server-side with `line_items` built from the user's cart. The client-side Stripe.js SDK redirects the user to Stripe's hosted payment page. On success, Stripe redirects to `/checkout/success` where the order is saved and the cart is cleared.

### 🚨 Error Handling
A custom error class with `httpStatusCode` is used. Errors are forwarded via `next(error)` to a centralized Express error-handling middleware that renders the appropriate error page.

## 💳 Stripe Test Cards

| Card Number | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| `4242 4242 4242 4242` | ✅ Payment succeeds |
| `4000 0000 0000 0002` | ❌ Payment declined |

Use any future expiry date and any 3-digit CVC.
